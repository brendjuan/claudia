# Stocks Projects
## Goals

Attempts to build a simple project around stock following, tracking, develop simple python based statistical analysis (Machine Learning too?), and simple gui interface

## Current State

The framework for downloading all stocks and options on the NYSE is in place, very crude. Working through threading the process and developing realtime stock following.
